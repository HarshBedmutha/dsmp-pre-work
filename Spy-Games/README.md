### Project Overview

  Job was to decipher a message that was received from our file. i have been given multiple text files that need to be read and have certain operations performed to get the  final message.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, I have a better understanding of solving logical problems using python. In this project, I have applied the following concepts:
String operations
Conditional statement and loops
File I/O
Functions


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 The First thing I did was write a function that reads message I called it "Message Reading" ,then wrote a function to extract the messages called it" Message Fusion", after extracting the message I had to make use of the messages from two different files and compare them and select only those words appered in first message and not in second one called it Message Substitution , then filtered them so as to select the words with even length using Filter function, and thus the combining all these steps I was able to successfully deciphered the messages
